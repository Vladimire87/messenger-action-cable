# Introduction

This is a simple follow along lesson to show you how Action Cable can be used to enhance an application to give it real time features. We won't explain everything in detail, as much of the setup instructions should be familiar to you but will take the time around the Action Cable specific content to explain things a little more.

The app we'll build will be in two stages. The first stage will be an app for sending messages only viewable to those currently logged in. We'll then build on it in the second stage to save the messages so that they are also viewable to anyone who logs in in the future.
